•	Project Overview: Developed a web-based car ride booking system where registered users can request a car for a ride. The system manages trip requests, assigns drivers, and processes payments.
•	Features:
o	User Management: Registered users can create accounts with details such as name, email, location, and unique ID.
o	Trip Request: Users send a ride request with pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distance, and unique trip ID.
o	Driver Assignment: The system allows the company to select nearby drivers based on the user's location. Drivers choose the trip they will handle. Each driver has a unique driver license ID.
o	Trip Management: Once the driver is selected, the trip is managed and tracked, including trip distance, pick-up, and drop-off locations.
o	Payment Processing: After the trip is completed, the user makes the payment to the driver for the services provided.
This project aimed to create an efficient and seamless car ride booking experience, automating driver assignments and ensuring accurate trip management and payment processing.
